        <p>Best Friends are just like a brother and sister's to you. They’ve been there for you through the good times,
           the rough moments, and everything in between. They pick you up when you’re feeling down and lift you up even 
           higher when you’re on top of the world.They’re your other half and partner in crime. Whether you’ve known your 
           bestie for years or your link is fairly new, these friendship will resonate with both of you. Maybe you're lucky
            enough to see your BFF every day, or perhaps you don't see them nearly as often as you'd like but none of that 
            matters one little bit when it comes to a true companionship. Friends are rare to find, so if you have one cherish it.

        <p font-style="arial">Dance is an  art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences
           of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers 
           and observers within a particular culture.Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its
            repertoire of movements, or by its historical period.The very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate
             an that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires 
             time-keepingust as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become 
             refined, something of the quality of dance.
